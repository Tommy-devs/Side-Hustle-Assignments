DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COOKIES AND SESSIONS
Session can store any type of data because the value is of data type of “object”. They are stored at server side which are secured because it is stored in binary format/encrypted form and gets decrypted at server.
Session is independent for every client i.e. individual for every client, and there is no limitation on the size or number of sessions to be used in an application.
Though they can be a burden or an overhead on server. they can be used without cookies
Sessions are called as Non-Persistent cookies because its life time can be set manually
while
Cookies can store only “string” datatype and are stored at client side.
